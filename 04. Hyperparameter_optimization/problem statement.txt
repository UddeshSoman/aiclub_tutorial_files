In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. 

A CNN model is prepared using 'Digits' dataset, the task is to find optimal set of hyperparameters to improve its performance.

This Demo has been prepared referring to multiple other tutorials.

The dataset is also available at

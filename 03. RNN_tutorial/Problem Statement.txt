Tutorial 1
Numeric Sequences have been prepared using python code and used for training and evaluation of RNN models. 
Varrious kinds of RNN's have been demonstrated in the tutorial.

Tutorial 2
Word prediction is implemented using RNN. the data contains 3 word long sentences.
The final model takes in two words as input and predicts the third word.
